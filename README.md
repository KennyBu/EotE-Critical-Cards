# Star Wars: Edge of the Empire Critical Cards

A simpler method for determining critical hits heavily inspired by [C. Steven Ross’ Critical Cards](http://triumphdespair.wordpress.com/2014/07/11/critical-cards/)

## How it Works
When a character, ship, or vehicle would normally suffer a critical hit, roll a single d10 instead. Essentially, anytime the rules call to add +10 to the critical roll, add +1 instead. Specifically, add +1 to that roll for each of the following:
* Each critical hit held by the victim already
* If the weapon used is a disruptor
* Each rank of the Vicious quality in the weapon
* Each wound in excess of the Wound Threshold

Likewise, each rank of Durable on the character subtracts one from the roll.

If the result is between 1 and 6, randomly draw from the “Minor” cards (previously “Easy”). Draw from “Major” (previously “Average”) between 7 and 11. Draw from “Severe” (previously “Hard”) on a result of 12 to 15. Rolls of 16 or higher draw the appropriate “Final” card (a new category of critical hit that is usually “death with a slim chance to escape”).
