# Star Wars: Edge of the Empire Critical Cards

A simpler method for determining critical hits heavily inspired by [C. Steven Ross’ Critical Cards](http://triumphdespair.wordpress.com/2014/07/11/critical-cards/)

## How it Works
When a character, ship, or vehicle would normally suffer a critical hit, roll a single d10 instead. Essentially, anytime the rules call to add +10 to the critical roll, add +1 instead. Specifically, add +1 to that roll for each of the following:
* Each critical hit held by the victim already
* If the weapon used is a disruptor
* Each rank of the Vicious quality in the weapon
* Each wound in excess of the Wound Threshold

Likewise, each rank of Durable on the character subtracts one from the roll.

Total Result | Effect
-------------|-------
1 to 6       | Draw one card from the “Minor” cards (previously “Easy”).
7 to 11      | Draw one card from the “Major” cards (previously “Average”). 
12 to 15     | Draw one card from the “Severe” cards (previously “Hard”).
16 or above  | Draw the appropriate “Final” card (a new category of critical hit that is an amalgam of Daunting and Death results that is roughly “death with a slim chance to escape”).

## Main Changes from C. Stephen Ross' Version
First, Mr. Ross' version is fantastic and is clearly the inspiration for this. You should definitely check [his version]((http://triumphdespair.wordpress.com/2014/07/11/critical-cards/)) out to see if it is to your liking. The idea of this is more-or-less the same but is kinder to the player in a couple of ways.

His version only contained "Minor" and "Major" which combined "Easy/Average" and "Hard/Daunting" from the published system. This breaks these out into defined layers to reduce the chance of drawing a nasty critical on your first, relatively minor critical hit. Additionally, I have removed Daunting entirely and combined the  "Bleeding Out" with "Death" to come up with a marginally friendlier, fatal critical hit.
